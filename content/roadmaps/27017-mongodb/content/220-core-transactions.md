# Transactions

A transaction is a sequence of database operations that will only succeed if every operation within the transaction has been executed correctly.

In MongoDB, an operation on a single document is atomic. For situations that require atomicity of reads and writes to multiple documents (in a single or multiple collections), MongoDB supports multi-document transactions. With distributed transactions, transactions can be used across multiple operations, collections, databases, documents, and shards.
