# Time Series

Time series data is a sequence of data points in which insights are gained by analyzing changes over time. Time series data is generally composed of these components:
1. <b>Time</b> when the data point was recorded.
2. <b>Metadata</b> (sometimes referred to as source), which is a label or tag that uniquely identifies a series and rarely changes.
3. <b>Measurements</b> (sometimes referred to as metrics or values), which are the data points tracked at increments in time. Generally these are key-value pairs that change over time.
